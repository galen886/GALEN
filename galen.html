<h1>September - October</h1>
<h2>SAT prep and disassociation</h2>
<p>During this time-period, I was really feeling down I would say. I was really demotivated, unmoved, just was living through life as if it was a spongebob re-run for the thousandth time. At that time, it was my last year in high school, and I was studying for the SAT, but I was more focused on everything but the SAT itself. I found myself doing anything but studying for the SAT, and I even had some online tutor, but I didn’t like him at all. Not because of the SAT, rather, his teaching methods are just not teaching and it is almost impossible cooperating with someone like that who doesn’t see any flaws in what they do. But nevertheless, I signed myself up for the SAT in October, and I instilled fake confidence in myself that I was going to pass that test, even making myself feel hype waking up at 4am and watching some videos of how to use desmos the day of the test. The feeling I had when taking that SAT test in October was guilt. I sat in that car and told my mom ‘I passed that test’, but when 2 weeks came and I was at home, I knew I couldn’t dodge the inevitable. Prior to me coming home, I knew my score already since I got the email, but I didn’t know when it was going to get to my parents. So as I stared long at the dense, but cracking ceiling in my AP Literature class, I was just imagining the result of the conversation I am going to have when I get home. I knew it was going to be something I probably haven’t seen in a while, since I haven’t failed or found myself into trouble for a very long time leading up to this point, so the thought of it created tension in my mind as I walked out of the school building.

 <h2>day of scores</h2>
 <p>When I get home, no one is home at all. Which, in a sense is relief, but in another sense it just plays with my mind even more. The thought of disappointment is replaying in my head as if it is a top charting song, a never-ending experience that feels so drawn out. So I just sit there and play some Roblox you know, the same thing that I used to avoid myself from studying, the same drug that I have found myself a repeat offender of, and the same thing I am addicted to, where withdrawals from t</p>
 <br>
<p> I sit and play for a while, then I hear my mom push the garage key to lower it, and this time it felt different. The same garage that shuts all the time with its loud clump, shut very lightly today, with its thoughts being more happy today than on most days. I greet her, and as I’m greeting her, I am analyzing her face all over, detecting any sly irregular facial expressions, abnormal ways of looking at me, even the gaze of her on me, just to see if she knows something that I also know, but it is completely normal. She just walks to her room. Usually I’m thinking, if she won’t react, then probably my dad will. So as I watched the time tick down to 8, the only thing I was thinking about was what he was going to say. I'm 18 years old man. No way in hell am I getting whipped or grounded or something like that, my parents don’t even ground me like that because I am just not that type of kid that does anything stupid or foolish for them to consider that. I just do what needs to be done and move on with my day. </p>
<br>
<p>So when he comes home, I greet him, and he just goes and takes a shower and comes back out. You can tell when he comes out, the door has a different type of shut than when my mom shuts the door. Her type of shutting the door is like an extra SFX you don’t hear in the background until you replay the song, but my dad shutting the door illuminates the whole house. I think most of the time, when he shuts the door, the AC realizes its job and goes back to working and it just times itself with when the door closes and when he walks out to properly go on schedule. So as he walks out and goes on the couch, I just have that sensation I am going to be called over. My dad is a fairly short person, big belly you know, the usual african dad, but he is a thinker, he isn’t like the usual african dad in a sense that they will probably overreact and not have reasoning behind their words, but because of his job position (Nurse Practictioner / Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner / Travel Nurse ) </p>
